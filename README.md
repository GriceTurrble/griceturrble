### Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

- **Pronouns**: he/him
- **Learning**: Django DRF with Vue.js, Docker, and all the fancypants web tech that seems to move so quickly these days.
- **Working on**:
  - [`python-amazon-mws`][pam_link], a pure-Python wrapper for the Amazon MWS API.
  - [`python-amazon-spapi`][pasapi_link], a successor to python-amazon-mws to utilize Amazon's Selling Partner API.
  - Personal website projects, a blog, random little projects.

I am a software engineer living in New Jersey, employed at Bank of America as a Software Engineer II in the Global Technology & Operations division. Fluent in Python, the Django framework, and developing on Windows (we exist!) while deploying on Linux.

> **Disclaimer**: everything I say or write here, on GitHub, on my profile, in messages, in emails, in the ether, etc.; is a representation of me and me alone. I do not represent Bank of America, I am not advertising for them, I do not speak for them, etc. I just work here!

Previously I worked for an e-commerce firm that sold products on the Amazon marketplace, among others. For that firm, I built a proprietary inventory management system in Django, using Zurb Foundation, some vanilla JS, a touch of Vue, PDF generation in ReportLab, and some light hardware integration. Hooked it up to the Amazon MWS API to do some automated shipment and listing updates. (That system is closed source held by the firm, so while I can talk some shop privately and share my experience, you won't find that system here. Sorry!)

Per that work, I got interested in the package used to speak to Amazon MWS, [`python-amazon-mws`][pam_link]. I am now one of the maintainers on that project, which is not yet to a 1.0 release status. Help is appreciated, both there and with the newer [`python-amazon-spapi`][pasapi_link] as well!
