üëãüèª I'm Galen (he/him), a developer with broad webdev knowledge who specializes in backend engineering using **Python** and the **Django** framework. Have been working with both since 2014.

I have a small [personal blog][galenrice.com] (hosted [here on GitHub!][galenrice.com-repo]) where I (infrequently) write on topics that interest me and intermediate-level tutorials related to Django and Python (no tutorial hell here).

## ‚öô Working with...

- FastAPI
- Pandas
- Polars
- Docker
- SQL, with a preference for PostgreSQL
- [HTMX] and [Hyperscript]
- GitHub Actions

## üõ† Familiar with (though no expert in)...

- Django (models, migrations, APIs in DRF, all of it)
- Django REST Framework
- Flask
- JavaScript

## Learning

- _All of the above; it never stops!_
- Helm charts
- Kubernetes
- C#

## Other stuff

For details on my work history, please check out my [LinkedIn profile][linkedin].

I am a maintainer on [python-amazon-mws], a pure-Python wrapper for Amazon's MWS API. Said MWS is in decline, in favor of Amazon's newer SP-API; and unfortunately I have neither the time nor interest to make the leap where others have already done some fine work.
