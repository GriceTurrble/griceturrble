I am a software engineer living in New Jersey, employed at Bank of America as an Applications Programmer in Global Technology & Operations division. Fluent in Python, the Django framework, and developing on Windows (we exist!) while deploying on Linux.

Previously I worked for an ecommerce firm that sold products on the Amazon marketplace, among others. For that firm, I built a proprietary inventory management system in Django, using Zurb Foundation, some vanilla JS, a touch of Vue, PDF generation in ReportLab, and some light hardware integration. Hooked it up to the Amazon MWS API to do some automated shipment and listing updates. (That system is closed source held by the firm, so while I can talk some shop privately and share my experience, you won't find that system here. Sorry!)
